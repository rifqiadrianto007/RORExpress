Introduction
This project aims to solve the problem of allocating items to a fleet of vehicles based on their carrying capacities. By utilizing the dynamic knapsack algorithm, we can determine the most efficient way to group items so that the total weight carried by each vehicle does not exceed its capacity. Additionally, the project includes implementations of linear search and bubble sort algorithms to enhance data handling and manipulation.

Features
    1. Dynamic Knapsack Algorithm: Efficiently allocate items to vehicles based on their weight capacities.
    2. Linear Search: A straightforward implementation for searching through lists.
    3. Bubble Sort: A simple sorting algorithm to order items based on specific criteria.
